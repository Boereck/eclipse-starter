//! This module provides the public function `get_exe_path()` which provides the

//! original C version, it should be investigated if a simple call to `std::fs::canonicalize`
//! would suffice.

/// (and if the resolved file is a symlink as well it will continue resolving)
/// and the resolved file will be returned.
