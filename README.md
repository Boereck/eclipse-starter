# Eclipse-Starter

NOTE: This project is in an early prototyping phase.

The aim of this project is to rewrite the [Eclipse launcher](https://github.com/eclipse/rt.equinox.framework/tree/master/features/org.eclipse.equinox.executable.feature) executable and library in Rust.
The first step is to rewrite the executable, and still be compatible with the existing library.

# Build

The build is currently very easy. The current version of Rust has to be installed and `cargo build` has to be called in the root directory of the project.
